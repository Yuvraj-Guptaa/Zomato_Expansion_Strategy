# **Zomato Expansion Strategy: A Data-Driven Approach**

This repository contains the analysis and strategic recommendations for Zomato's global expansion, based on a comprehensive dataset of restaurant information. The project's goal is to identify high-potential countries and cities for new restaurant openings, focusing on markets with low competition and high growth opportunities.

## **üìù Project Objective**

The primary objective of this analysis is to provide Zomato with a data-driven strategy for expanding its restaurant network into new international markets. This involves:

* Identifying countries with low restaurant density and favorable market conditions.  
* Pinpointing specific cities within those countries that are suitable for new restaurant openings.  
* Analyzing the impact of various factors, such as online delivery, table booking, and cuisine choice, on restaurant ratings.  
* Providing actionable recommendations to guide Zomato's expansion efforts.

## **üìä Analysis Approach**

The analysis was conducted using a dataset of Zomato restaurant information, which includes details on location, cuisine, ratings, and services. The following steps were taken:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The raw data was cleaned to handle missing values (e.g., filling in missing cuisines), remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency across the dataset.  
2. **Question-Driven Analysis:** A detailed analysis was performed by answering specific business questions. This involved using pivot tables and various calculations to understand the distribution of restaurants, average ratings, and the availability of key services across different countries.  
3. **Market Opportunity Analysis:** Countries were evaluated based on the number of existing restaurants, average ratings, and the prevalence of online delivery services to identify unsaturated markets.  
4. **Competitive Analysis:** The restaurant landscape in target countries was analyzed to identify key competitors and underserved market segments.  
5. **Strategic Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, a set of strategic recommendations was developed to guide Zomato's expansion strategy.

A dashboard was created to provide an interactive and visual summary of the key findings. It includes slicers for filtering by year and country, allowing for a dynamic exploration of metrics such as average cost, ratings, online delivery penetration, and top cuisines.

## **üîë Key Findings**

* **High-Potential Markets:** The analysis identified **Canada, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Australia** as promising markets for expansion due to their relatively low restaurant density and potential for growth.  
* **Impact of Online Services:** Restaurants offering **online delivery and table booking** tend to have higher customer ratings, indicating the importance of these services in enhancing the customer experience.  
* **Cuisine Popularity:** Certain cuisines, such as **American, Steak, Seafood, Italian, and Pizza**, are popular across multiple countries and are associated with higher ratings.  
* **Price vs. Rating:** There is no significant correlation between the price of a restaurant and its rating, suggesting that customers prioritize quality and value over price.

## **üöÄ Strategic Recommendations**

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed for Zomato's expansion strategy:

* **Prioritize Target Markets:** Focus on entering the identified high-potential markets: Canada, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Australia.  
* **Emphasize Online Services:** Ensure that new restaurants are equipped with online delivery and table booking capabilities to meet customer expectations.  
* **Offer Popular Cuisines:** Curate a selection of popular and high-rated cuisines to attract a broad customer base.  
* **Focus on Value:** Emphasize quality and value in restaurant offerings, rather than competing solely on price.
